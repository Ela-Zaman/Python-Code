# A for loop is effective for looping through a list, but you shouldnâ€™t modify a list inside a for loop because Python will have trouble keeping track of
# the items in the list. To modify a list as you work through it, use a while loop.
# Using while loops with lists and dictionaries allows you to collect, store, and
# organize lots of input to examine and report on later.
